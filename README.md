# vulnerability-Assessment-patching-Semi-Automation
## vulnerability_Assessment_patch_pkg_render.py:
   This script will give you the package name list that needs to be updated for patching the server group.  The list is obtained by rendering the VA report provided by the infosec team by grouping the column "plugin_text" based on the node_type and then filter the package by removing the duplication.

## vulnerability_Assessment_USN_action_v2.py:
   This script will give you the ACTION items (Restart or Reboot or Standard system update) required for the given USN number in the document.

# Prerequisites for excel report
> 1)Add the column "Hostname" in the VA sheet to match the "IP address" column provided in the report.

> 2)Delete a formula and keep only the value from the cells if any formula used, as this python script will read the cell on its value.

> 3)Make sure your workstation has network connectivity to reach https://usn.ubuntu.com/ ,as the script will do curl call for each USN number given.
