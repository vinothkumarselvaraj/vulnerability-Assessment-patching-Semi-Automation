# vulnerability-Assessment-patching-Semi-Automation
vulnerability_Assessment_patch_pkg_render.py: This script will give you the package name list that needs to be updated for patching the server group.  The list is obtained by rendering the VA report provided by the infosec team by grouping the column "plugin_text" based on the node_type and then filter the package by removing the duplication.
